# Roblox-Exclusive-Fullscreen 
Run roblox in Exclusive-Fullscreen to fix common FPS issues for low end computers

# Introduction
Some years ago Roblox disabled a feature to make the game run in Exclusive Fullscreen, the feature used to be good for performance especially in low end computers. This application will create a fflag in Roblox's client settings folder so the game will be able to run in Exclusive-Fullscreen again.

# How-To
1. Download the release from https://github.com/Gianpi612/RobloxEXF/releases/latest
2. Extract RobloxEsclusive-Fullscreen-x64.zip into a folder
3. Run RobloxEsclusive-Fullscreen.exe before starting Roblox
4. Run Roblox and then press ALT + Enter
5. Done
